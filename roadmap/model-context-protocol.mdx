# What is Model Context Protocol?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless
integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. Whether
you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating
custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the
context they need.
