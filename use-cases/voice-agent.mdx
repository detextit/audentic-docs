## Best Practices for Informational Agents

Creating an effective informational voice agent requires careful planning and configuration. Here are key strategies to maximize engagement:

### Task Description

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Be Clear and Specific" icon="bullseye">
    Write a detailed task description that outlines your agent's primary
    purpose. For example: "You are a friendly guide helping visitors learn about
    our company. Explain our mission, products, and team culture using
    conversational language. Focus on engaging visitors and answering their
    questions about who we are and what we do."
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The below is the task description provided to the agent on our home page - [audentic.io](https://audentic.io)

<Note>
  You are the PR person for "Audentic" (pronounced awe-den-tic), a voice AI
  company. Answer questions related to your company. Keep responses short. Use
  the provided data to answer questions. Start conversation with "Hey, would you
  like to know more about us". Refrain from answering questions about
  competition or on topics outside your scope. You can redirect user to contact
  Audentic via email at info@audentic.io or check out the website audentic.io
</Note>

### Knowledge Base Setup

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Structure Information Hierarchically" icon="sitemap">
    Organize your knowledge base into clear categories: - Company Overview -
    Product/Service Details - Team Information - FAQs - Success Stories
  </Card>
  <Card title="Include Rich Context" icon="book-open">
    Add detailed entries about: - Company history and milestones - Mission and
    values - Team bios and expertise - Product features and benefits - Customer
    testimonials
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Rather than just providing the website content, focus on additional information that enhances the user experience -- if you have a product, focus on motivation, features, and such.

### Advanced Tips

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Page-Specific Knowledge" icon="file-code">
    Create separate knowledge entries for different pages of your website. This
    helps your agent provide contextual information based on where the visitor
    is browsing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Progressive Disclosure" icon="layer-group">
    Structure information from high-level overview to detailed specifics. Let
    visitors choose how deep they want to go into any topic.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Engagement Hooks" icon="hand-point-up">
    If you are a startup, include conversation hooks to follow up with users:
    "Would you like to learn more about our pricing?" or "Do you want to set up
    a call with our team to discuss POC?"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Clear Handoffs" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left">
    Configure when to suggest human contact for complex inquiries or sales
    opportunities.

## Testing and Iteration

Before launching your informational agent:

1. **Test Different Scenarios**: Run through various user journeys to ensure comprehensive coverage
2. **Gather Feedback**: Use the Test Agent feature to preview interactions
3. **Monitor and Refine**: Regularly update your knowledge base based on common questions
4. **Review Conversations**: Analyze chat logs to identify areas for improvement

Remember, the goal is to create an engaging, informative experience that adds value to your visitors while maintaining their interest and encouraging deeper exploration of your website.
